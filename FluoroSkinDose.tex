\begin{abstract}
Fluoroscopy skin entrance exposure (SEE) rates are measured annually for various types of fluoroscopy imaging systems. SEE rates are measured for the different dose modes and mag modes provided by the system, and using different thicknesses of Lucite in the beam. SEE rates were collected from annual inspections of fixed fluoroscopy units, mobile c-arms, interventional radiology and cardiac cath labs.

Over all types of units, SEE in the normal image receptor mode with 20 cm Lucite in the beam was 11.6{$\pm$}5.7 mGy/min. With 10 cm of Lucite in the beam, SEE relative to 20 cm decreased by a factor of 0.17{$\pm$}0.06. With 30 cm of Lucite in the beam SEE relative to 20 cm increased by a factor of 4.8{$\pm$}2.2.

The SEE in Mag 1 mode was increased by a factor of 1.41{$\pm$}0.27 relative to the normal (non-mag) mode while in Mag 2 SEE increased by a factor of 2.16{$\pm$}0.79 relative to the normal mode. SEE for units with a low dose mode was decreased by a factor of 0.52{$\pm$}0.19 and SEE for the high dose mode was increased by a factor of 1.7{$\pm$}0.6 relative to the normal dose mode.

Fluoscopy SEE data was collected from the annual performance surveys for all units tested over a one year period. The types and numbers of x-ray tubes is listed in the table below

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Type of unit & No of Tubes \\
\hline 
RF & 7 \\ 
\hline 
C-arm & 20 \\ 
\hline 
Angiography & 11 \\ 
\hline 
Cardiac Cath Lab & 15 \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 

\caption{Types and number of tubes used for SEE data}
\end{table}

Fluoroscopy SEE rates were measured using the geometry specified by the FDA and codified in 10CFR1020.23(d)(3). The source-image receptor distance was set to minimum and the ionization chamber was positioned 30 cm from the image receptor centered in the field of view. SEE rates were measured for all image receptor magnification modes (up to four including the normal non-magnified mode), up to three dose modes and for 10, 20 and 30 cm of Lucite absorber in the beam.
